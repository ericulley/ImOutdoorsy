The patrol cabin a few miles in was a perfect place to sit down and eat lunch in the shade. On the way back, we saw two deer and a black bear too.",

Eventually, the trail turns north, the singletrack flattens somewhat, and speeds along through the forest until it intersects with Big Rocks Trail. Most of the jumps have gaps and all have ride around options. Lithium Trail ends by intersecting with the end of Black Canyon Trail.",
